Project Description

This project will examine the relationship between governance (especially Rule of Law indexes) and development using data from 1996-2014. Key goals and project outcomes will be to provide concrete evidence of the importance of accountability, protection of fundamental rights, and the accessibility and efficiency of legislative and judicial systems, and to examine potential differences in the relationship between governance and development in countries at different stages of development. Analysis will be performed using governance and development levels in 1996 as well as continuously compounded annualized growth rates from the eighteen year period.
